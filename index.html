					<h4>Abstract:</h4>
                    <p>The occurrence of merge conflicts might impair software development.
					Developers might reduce conflicts by avoiding to perform tasks that change the same files in parallel.
					As predicting the set of files changed by a task is hard, we use the TAITI tool to compute task interfaces (an approximation of the changed files set).
					Such a tool takes as input a set of automated acceptance tests that validate the expected behavior of each task, assuming a BDD (Behaviour-Driven Development) context, in which tests guide code development.
					We measure the conflict risk between tasks as the intersection among its interfaces.
					To assess the predictions of conflict risk, we measure precision and recall of 6,360 task pairs from 19 Rails projects on GitHub.
					Our results confirm that Cucumber tests might help to predict the risk of merge conflicts, given the intersection among interfaces denotes a higher probability that the tasks change some file in common.
					A minimal intersection predicts conflict risk with 0.59 of precision and 0.98 of recall.
					Also, the higher the intersection size, the higher the number of files changed by both tasks.
					This way, developers might use the intersection size between TestI as a degree of conflict risk between tasks, prioritizing the selection of a task to work on whose TestI has the lowest intersection with others.
					Finally, a predictor of conflict risk based on TestI outperforms a predictor based on similar past tasks. 
					Regardless of promising results, sometimes the intersection among interfaces does not guess the conflicting files.

                    <h4>Study Setup</h4>
					<p> In brief, we performed three main search rounds. In the first round, we restricted the project’s maximum number of stars, sorting results by descending order of stars number, hoping to select more meaningful and popular projects. In the second round, we just sorted results by the date of the last update, to analyze first active projects. Finally, we verified the Ruby projects referenced by Cucumber’s site. As a result, we have a set of 61 selected Rails projects that use Cucumber, and a subset of 18 projects that additionally use Simplecov or Coveralls, which are coverage tools. </p>
					<p> After obtaining relevant projects that use the tools of interest for our study, we further filter out projects without a number of tasks that contribute with both production code and Cucumber tests. For extracting tasks from a given project, we clone the project repository and search for merge commits (excluding fast-forwarding merges) by using JGit API, sorting them by descending chronological order. We admit merge commits performed until September 30th, 2017. Then we extract two tasks from each merge commit, each one corresponding to one of the merged contributions. As preliminary filtering, we select tasks that change both production and Gherkin test files. Moreover, as a matter of performance while computing interfaces, we discard tasks that exceed 500 commits. The result of this mining phase refines the set of 61 projects we had from the previous phase, discarding 30 projects (14 projects do not contain merge commits and 16 projects do not contain any task that both changes production and Gherkin files). In brief, we have a set of tasks extracted from 31 Rails projects that use Cucumber, and a subset of 15 projects that additionally use the mentioned coverage tools. Besides that, we have a set of tasks for which we possibly can compute other interfaces we study here except DTestI, and a subset of tasks for which we can compute DTestI. </p>
					<p>Once we have a tasks set, we move on to the execution phase. First, we identified the acceptance tests of each task as added or modified scenarios by task's commit. Next, we computed ITest according to eight different configurations and IReal, and we evaluated precision and recall for each task.</p>
